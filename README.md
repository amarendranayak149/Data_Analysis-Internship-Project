## Level 1: Basic Analysis
1. **Top Cuisines**  
   - Determine the top three most common cuisines.  
   - Calculate the percentage of restaurants serving each top cuisine.

2. **City Analysis**  
   - Identify the city with the highest number of restaurants.  
   - Calculate the average restaurant rating for each city.  
   - Determine the city with the highest average rating.

3. **Price Range Distribution**  
   - Visualize the distribution of price ranges using a histogram or bar chart.  
   - Calculate the percentage of restaurants in each price range.

4. **Online Delivery**  
   - Determine the percentage of restaurants offering online delivery.  
   - Compare average ratings for restaurants with and without online delivery.

1. **Restaurant Ratings**  
   - Analyze the distribution of aggregate ratings.  
   - Determine the most common rating range.  
   - Calculate the average number of votes received by restaurants.

2. **Cuisine Combination**  
   - Identify the most common combinations of cuisines.  
   - Analyze if certain combinations have higher ratings.

3. **Geographic Analysis**  
   - Plot restaurant locations using longitude and latitude.  
   - Identify patterns or clusters in specific areas.
